## Counter Intuitive

Changing a session in Putty is counter intuitive:

1. The intuitive approach would be to choose `Change Settings...` from the Putty menu. This unfortunately leads you to a dialog with a restricted set of options and is probably not what you want.
2. Even when you choose the correct option (`New Session...`) it is **very easy** to forget to both load **and** save the correct session.
